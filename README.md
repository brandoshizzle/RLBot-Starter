# RLBot Starter
A library to use with the RLBot framework to easily create Python bots.

## Install some Programs
You'll need to install three things:
- Rocket League (for testing)
- [RLBot GUI](https://github.com/RLBot/RLBotGUI/releases/download/v1.0/RLBotGUI.msi)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

The RLBot GUI installation should also install Python 3.7.9 for you.

## Create your bot
**Always** open RLBotGUI, not Rocket League. RLBotGUI will open Rocket League for you.
1. Open RLBotGUI
2. Click on "Create New Bot".
3. Select Python
4. Give you bot a name (can be changed later)


## Changing the bot
- Bot behavior is controlled by editing `src/bot_actions.py`
1. Find your bot in RLBotGUI
2. Click "Edit"
3. Right-click "bot_actions.py" and select "Open in VSCode"
4. Start programming! Go to the [wiki]() to guide you

- Bot appearance is done in RLBotGUI
